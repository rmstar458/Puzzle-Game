**Interactive Puzzle : ** Soft skills are a combination of personal attributes, social and communication abilities, and emotional intelligence that enable individuals to interact effectively with others, work well in teams, and accomplish their goals. The soft skills that are assessed by this puzzle are : Problem solving, Communication skills, Eye of details, Aptitude, Curiosity, Attendance to details, Time Management etc.

**Possible way to solve the puzzle : ** The Puzzle game game is based on the theme of ‘Treasure of Eldorado’ where user needs to pass certain levels using their soft skills to find the treasure.


The First level is based upon General Aptitude and uses some tricky Math as 5 gives 32 in the way that 5 square is 25 and add 25 with its digits gives the result. I.e. 5 = (25+5+2) = 32 , same with 7 = (49+4+9) =62, 9 = ( 81+8+1) = 90. So 11 will give (121+1+2+1) = 125. So the answer to first question is 125. But if you choose some other gate then it will lead you to some other way and you will be stuck in the deadend.

The second level is checks your eye details and problem solving and it has Security gate image where you can see there are 2 boards hanging on the top corners. One says “WELCOME TO ELDORADO” ans the second says “EELCOMW OT OLDORADE”. These sign boards shoes same message but in different language . So WELCOME is EELCOMW ,TO is OT and ELDORADO is OLDORADE. Now to obtain EELCOMW from WELCOME just reverse the word WELCOME as EMOCLEW than leaving the first and last character unchanged and swapping the second with last second, third with last third and so on so you will get EELCOMW. So THANKS is encoded as : Reverse the THANKS -> SKNAHT. Leaving first and last character and swapping second and second last, third and third last and so on SKNAHT -> SHANKT. Ao SHANKT is the answer. Here there in no other choice other than this one gate, so no deadend is there.

The third level shows the curiosity of the user. In this level user needs to find the hidden words. Here below are the hidden words shown. As here also there is no other choice, so no deadend is here.

The Fourth level is where your attention comes into play. On the starting page of the website there was Poem and the answer lies there. The poem was :
So according to the poem the Answer is part 3 I.e. Head. As There is 4 choices to go with . So choosing other choice will lead you to a state where you will be stuck in a deadend.

The level 5 is related to your communication skills and your memory. In the 4 level there was some poem written on the leaves of the trees and some villager tell you the story. In the story it state that “The Ocean hold the treasure untold”. So the main treasure lies inside the water. So here if you see the pic of the cave, the answer is option 4.

The final level is based on your mathematical skills. Here the Product is 36 and 2 digits are same while largest one is unique, so the answer is 229.
